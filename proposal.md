### Tentative Project Title

COVID Vaccination Rate in NYC

### Motivation

In the last three years of COVID-19 pandemic, vaccines and booster
vaccines have been helpful to reduce COVID infections in general. Due to
systematic disparities in access to health resources, we are interested
in exploring whether there exist disparities in vaccination rates across
different races, ages, and geographies. We want to examine the possible
associations between vaccination rate and a range of demographic &
geographic predictors. Lastly, taking the population in NYC as a whole,
we aim to assess the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in NYC across
time by monitoring the trend in three health outcomes: a) infection rate
(first infection & reinfection), b)death, c) hospitalization .

### Intended Final Products

-   A website hosted on github page
-   A screencast on YouTube
-   Interactive map of covid vaccination rate in NYC
-   Data visualizations of vaccination rate in different demography,
    races, counties
-   Report

### The Anticipated Data Sources

-   NYC reinfection data from the Department of Health of New York
    State:
    <https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/New-York-State-Statewide-COVID-19-Reinfection-Data/7aaj-cdtu>
-   NYC Covid Data:
    <https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-main.page>
-   Cumulative (by day) Vaccination Numbers:
    <https://github.com/nychealth/covid-vaccine-data/blob/main/doses/doses-by-day.csv>
-   Repos: by doses -
    <https://github.com/nychealth/covid-vaccine-data/tree/main/doses> by
    people -
    <https://github.com/nychealth/covid-vaccine-data/tree/main/people>
-   NY COVID variant data:
    <https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/covid-19-variant-data>

### The Planned Analyses / Visualizations / Coding Challenges

-   Planned analyses
    -   Identify covid vaccination disparities across demographic/
        geographical factors and investigate significant factors by
        using an ANOVA model
    -   Examine relationship between vaccination rate and covid health
        outcomes (death, hospitalization, infection rate) in NYC across
        time
    -   Compare infection waves and vaccination rate with covid-19 virus
        variant sequencing count by week
-   Visualization
    -   Map of nyc colored by vaccination rate (choropleth)
    -   Bar plots
    -   Bubble plot in nytimesheatmap
-   Coding challenges
    -   Preprocess data to include data only for NYC & data after covid
        vaccines became available on 2021-01-01:
    -   Learn to make interactive map of NYC

### Planned Timeline

-   November 3-9: Brainstorm
-   November 12: Submit Proposal
-   November 15-18: Project review meeting
-   December 10: Submit Report + Webpage/Screencast + Peer Assessment
