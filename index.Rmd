## Background

Since the discovery of multiple cases of COVID-19 in December 2019, the outbreak has spread rapidly across the globe, resulting in many infections and deaths and posing a significant threat to global public health security. Because no targeted drug is available, a vaccine for the coronavirus is critical to contain the spread of COVID-19. We currently have several major vaccines and booster vaccines available from Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson in NYC, which have shown promising results in reducing the overall infection rate.

But inequities in global vaccine access are also becoming apparent. Due to systematic disparities in access to health resources, we are interested in exploring whether there exist disparities in vaccination rates across different races, ages, gender, and geographies in NYC. 

Taking the population in NYC as a whole, we would like to know whether different variants coincide with specific infection peaks and vaccination rate patterns over time. We are also interested in if there are any associations between vaccination rate and infection rate (first infection & reinfection). Also, we collect the dataset about two health outcomes: a)death and b) hospitalization, and are interested in the trends of the total number of those outcomes over time.

## Datasets

For the purpose of characterizing the pattern of the COVID-19 vaccination rate and infection rate(first infectin and reinfection) in NYC over time:

* We used `doses by day data` to see the trends of getting shots of every vaccine. [Doses By Day Data](https://github.com/nychealth/covid-vaccine-data/blob/main/doses/doses-by-day.csv)

* We also filtered data of NYC on `Reinfection Data`, which gave us timely information about the trends in first infections and reinfections in New York City. [Reinfection Data](https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/New-York-State-Statewide-COVID-19-Reinfection-Data/7aaj-cdtu)

For exploring whether different variants coincide with specific infection peaks and vaccination rate patterns over time:

* We collected `Variant Data` from [Variant Data](https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/covid-19-variant-data)

For researching the trends of the counts of hospitalizations and deaths:

* We used the `COVID-19_Daily_Counts_of_Cases__Hospitalizations__and_Deaths` dataset to obtain the daily counts of hospitalizations and deaths.

For exploring whether there exist disparities in vaccination rates across different races, ages, gender, and geographies:

* we traced back in history and merged all the data related to "coverge by demo" to `coverage by demo full data` and "coverage by boro demo" to `coverage boro demo full` from [People](https://github.com/nychealth/covid-vaccine-data/tree/main/people)


## Focus of our Project

Considering the area in NYC, knowing that the COVID-19 vaccine is effective, We aimed to show trends in vaccination rate and infection rate to roughly see the vaccine efficacy and the trends in the total number of hospitalizations and deaths to seek some insight. Furthermore, regarding variant classifications, we want to visualize the overall trend of variant sequencing during the pandemic. And because of the existence of global vaccine disparities, we tried to investigate associations between the vaccination rate and a range of demographic & geographic factors.


## Main Questions

We followed our exploratory by some detailed questions:

* What is the *trend* of cumulative vaccination counts in NYC?

* What is the *trend* in infection/reinfection counts, and is there any interesting information we can recognize when comparing this to the abovementioned trends? 

* What is the *trend* among various vaccine types?

* What is the *trend* of hospitalizations and deaths?

* Are vaccination rates influenced by demographic/race-based features? If so, what are the underlying *trends*? 

* What should be the *predictors* for vaccination rate? Also, is there a *significant association* between vaccination rate and races / ages / gender / boroughs?

* any predicted model? 


## Take away

* There do exist demographic differences amongst vaccination trends in New York City.

* In general, the booster vaccination rate is lower than the primary series vaccination rate across the board.

* Vaccination rate differs across age-groups and a larger group of adults (compared to children under 18) are vaccinated against COVID (at least primary series).

* Vaccination rates differ by geography (borough level), race, gender, and age groups.
