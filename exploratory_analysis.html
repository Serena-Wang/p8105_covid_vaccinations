variant name of positive tests, and number of positive tests for each
variant. This figure plots the proportion of occurrence for each variant
throughout the pandemic.</p>

<h2>Vaccination Rate - Demographic Features</h2>
<p>We are interested in comparing COVID-19 vaccination rates of
different demographic groups in NYC. In this section, we are analyzing
COVID-19 vaccination rates with data from NYC Health. NYC Health curates
daily COVID-19 vaccination data stratified by a handful of demographic
features such as age, race/ethnicity, sex and boroughs. It also include
granular vaccination information such as primary does, booster doses, at
least 1 dose.</p>
<p>Here is detailed vaccination status defined by NYC Health (credits to
NYC Health Github Repository):</p>

Pfizer vaccine, or the single-dose series of the Johnson &amp; Johnson
vaccine. This was previously referred to as “fully vaccinated.”</td>

<td>At least one dose</td>

Pfizer or Moderna primary vaccine series or the one dose of the Johnson

AstraZeneca vaccine are only counted if they received both doses of the
two-dose vaccine.</td>

<td>People who have received additional doses of an FDA-approved vaccine
after completing their primary series. This includes first and second
booster shots, as well as additional doses for people who are
immunocompromised.</td>

<p>To adjust for population of each demographic group, we are analyzing
the estimated vaccination rate calculated by NYC Health. The first data
point is for May 23th, 2021, and all of the data we used in our analysis
are data as of November 29th, 2022.</p>
